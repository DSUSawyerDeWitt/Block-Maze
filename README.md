# Block-Maze(Python + Pygame-CE)
 - Block Maze is a 2D merge-and-build game where you stack similar blocks to upgrade to higher-level ones. A ball rolls through your maze, earning you more money for higher level blocks. This game was built using **Python** and **Pygame Community Edition**.
 - This project was developed entirely on my own and really put my skills to the test, especially when creating complex game logic and custom Sprites. I learned a lot working while working on it, and it helped me improve how I organize and maintain code for larger projects.
